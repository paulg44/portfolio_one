This is a README file for the bc14_w3_recap-task-paulg44 repository.
I will outline my rough plans for this repository here.

1. Create 3 user persona's and user stories
   a. Employer
   b. Fellow Developer
   c. Recruitment Agent
2. Think about user experience and what the persona's are looking for
3. Create a low-fidelity wireframe
   a. Desktop
   b. Mobile (responsive)
4. Create a high-fidelity wireframe
   a. Desktop
   b. Mobile (responsive)
5. Start coding!!!!

!User Persona's
See _persona's_ folder for more details

1. Employer
   Joe Bloggs is the managing director for a large software development company. He is looking for a junior web developer to join his team. He is looking for someone that has good team productivity and communication skills. He is also looking for someone with good time keeping skills who can work under pressure and to a resonable time scale.
   LinkedIn is the most used way to get in contact with Joe.

2. Fellow Developer
   Dave Smith is a web developer who has been working in the industry for 10 years. Currently he works for a small start up company, but often moves around or works freelance. Dave is always on the lookout for new opportunities and this includes collaborating with other talented developers.
   Dave is on multiple social media platforms with instagram being his most used.

3. Recruitment Agent
   Sue Pollock is a recruitment agent who works for a medium size recruitment agency, also known as headhunters. She is looking for a junior web developer to join a software development company. She is looking for someone who has good team productivity and communication skills.
   Sue often uses all social mediia platforms to find new candidates, but LinkedIn is her most used.

!Flow chart added for the basic flow of the website. Including the elements that will be used, and links to other pages.

!The idea behind my design is taken from many different components, the user persona's, some guest speaker's we have listened to, some website's I have used for inspriation and some of my own taste and preferences.
One of the main things I wanted to address is standing out from the crowd, as I heard from a speaker the other day. I am planning on going for a bold looking website that is easy to navigate through, making sure its visually appealing and not cluttered.

In terms of thinking about the user persona's I'm looking to address the Employer and Recruitment Agent in a similar way. I want the home screen to pop out and make an impression from the first time they enter the website. I want it to be easy to navigate through to the projects page and have multiple ways to contact me through social media, email and a contact form.

I will add a few little different things in for the fellow developer, maybe a few easter eggs so to speak, but nothing too fancy, a couple of animations and hover effects should be enough.

I will decide on my colours through some research into what colours are used for creativity and to stand out. I personally like a darker website that pops with a sharp colour or two, so this is the direction I will be going in.

The website will consist of a homepage, with an about me section, a navbar with a contact link and a logo, and a footer containing the social media links. There will also be a projects page with 3/4 projects on it as to not clutter the page. Each project will have a link to the github repo and a link to the live site if there is one. There will also be a contact page with a contact form. The contact form layout has taken inspiration from the Facebook homepage layout.

I have decided on a mainly black website with pink accents to the page to highlight certain parts or when elements are hovered etc.

!Added desktop_main_high wireframe, still getting used to figma, but I assume it has no animations and there's certain things I will be doing on the actual website that I can't in Figma. For example the angled text will straighten out when hovered and one or two will be connected to the links for other parts on the page, they will animate or change colour(hopefully) when interacted with.

!Added the desktop_projects_high wireframe this differs quite a bit from the low fidelity wireframe as i thought it looked too boxy and not creative enough. Again, I will be adding animations and hover effects to the page, but I will be doing this in code rather than in Figma. The titles of each page will have pink underline's and will also be links to the actual websites. The image of the mobile phone will rotate with 3 other images at timed intervals. The round github images will be replaced with a gihub icon thats also a link to the corresponding github repo. I've decided not to clutter the page with any images of the other projects, just descriptions and links. This is something I may revisit later on.

!Added the desktop_contact_high wireframe. I will propably change the background to an image, or a linear gradient, just as to have a change from the pure black on the other two pages. There will be a couple of animations on the email and phone icon's.
