Welcome to my portfolio readMe. 

This portfolio is currently made using vanilla HTML, CSS & Javascript. It was started when on the School of Code bootcamp and we had not yet used React.

I am planning on adding a blogpost page so I can practice a CRUD application and also keep weekly track of my learnings on this journey. To make this easier I'm probably going to have to refactor the site into React - this is my current task.
