I have spent the previous years of my career as a painter and decorator and I'm ready to wash out the rollers and brushes one more time and swap the brushstrokes for keystrokes.

It led me down the path of learning how to use a canvas in React, how to send data to and from client and server, how to parse that data and get exactly what I want. How to transform aan image to a base64 string, and how to use an AI engine to compare the image. Among many other things.",
